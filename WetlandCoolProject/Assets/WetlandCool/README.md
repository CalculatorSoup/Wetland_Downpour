# Wetland Downpour



Wetland Downpour is a loop-exclusive stage variant for Wetland Aspect with a lush, jungle-y theme and heavy rain. There aren't any new areas, but there are a few new random variations, some of which can drastically change a significant portion of the map.

## Features



### Gameplay Changes (compared to Wetland Aspect)

* Updated enemy spawn pools (Added Alloy Vultures and Grovetenders. Added Larvae and Solus Amalgamator after looping. Removed Beetles and Beetle Queen)
* Updated interactable pools (Drone scrappers can appear. Drone combiners can appear after looping)
* Added ~6 new random variations
* Removed the random variations where a stone gate rises up to block a shortcut into a corner
* Replaced/re-arranged all pillars, logs and other clutter throughout the map
* Added a third body of water
* The map is very slightly smaller overall



### Visual Changes

* There are now several distinct areas scattered throughout the map: an abandoned survivor camp, a flooded altar, dormant Lynx Totems, etc.
* Terrain textures are more saturated and the map is generally much more lush, with new mangrove trees, grass patches, and underwater foliage
* The giant shallow "lake" is now deep enough to completely submerge all non-modded survivors
* Water is clearer to make chests and other interactables more visible. Underwater post processing is a bit more noticeable
* Ground terrain now has more height variation, mostly to make transitions between dry ground and water look more natural
* The map is foggier and darker



## Config Options

* **Loop Variant** (default **true**): If true, functions like a vanilla post-loop stage (does not appear before looping, replaces Wetland Aspect after looping). If false, it never replaces Wetland Aspect and can appear at any time, like a normal stage
* **Replace Wetland Aspect** (default **false**): If true, always replaces Wetland Aspect, before and after looping, regardless of what value Loop Variant is set to



## Bugs / Issues



This is my first mod I've released for Risk of Rain 2 (and just generally the first mod I've ever completed and released for anything), so it's kind of a miracle that this works at all. I haven't tested it much outside of repeatedly playing it in singleplayer and multiplayer runs with/without ~100 other mods installed.



If you encounter any issue with the map, please let me know on GitHub or on Discord (@worms / @ry6240) and I'll try to fix it if I'm able to. Also feel free to message me if you have any feedback or suggestions.
