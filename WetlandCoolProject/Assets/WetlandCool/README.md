# \# Wetland Downpour

# 

# Wetland Downpour is a post-loop stage variant for Wetland Aspect which gives it a lush, almost jungle-y theme with heavy rain. There aren't any new areas, but there are a few new random variations, some of which can drastically change significant portions of the map.

# 

# There are a couple config options included:

# \- Loop Variant (default \*\*true\*\*): If true, functions like a vanilla post-loop stage (does not appear before looping, replaces Wetland Aspect after looping). If false, can appear alongside Wetland Aspect at any time, like a normal stage

# \- Replace Wetland Aspect (default \*\*false\*\*): If true, always replaces Wetland Aspect, before and after looping, regardless of what value Loop Variant is set to

# 

# \## Features

# 

# \### Gameplay Changes (compared to Wetland Aspect)

# \- Updated enemy spawn pools (Added Alloy Vultures and Grovetenders. Added Larvae and Solus Amalgamator after looping. Removed Beetles and Beetle Queen)

# \- Updated interactable pools (Drone scrappers can appear. Drone combiners can appear after looping)

# \- Added ~6 new random variations, some of which remove/alter large chunks of the map

# \- Removed the random variations where a stone gate rises up purely to spite survivors without vertical mobility

# \- Replaced/re-arranged all pillars, logs and other clutter throughout the map

# \- Ground terrain now has more height variation, mostly to make transitions between dry ground and water look more natural

# \- The giant shallow "lake" is now deep enough to completely submerge all vanilla survivors

# \- Added a third body of water

# \- Water is clearer, hopefully making interactables easier to spot. Underwater post processing is also a bit nicer

# \- Slightly smaller (I think I accidentally made it a bit smaller than most Stage 2s, but I kinda like it. Please let me know if you think it's too small)

# 

# 

# \### Visual Changes

# \- There are now several distinct areas scattered throughout the map: an abandoned survivor camp, a flooded altar, dormant Lynx Totems, etc.

# \- Terrain textures are more saturated and the map is generally much more lush, with new mangrove trees, grass patches, and underwater foliage

# \- Foggier and darker

# 

# \## Bugs / Issues

# 

# This is my first mod I've released for Risk of Rain 2 (and just generally the first mod I've ever completed and released for anything), so it's kind of a miracle that this works at all. I haven't tested it much outside of repeatedly playing it in singleplayer runs with/without ~100 other mods installed.

# 

# If you encounter any issue with the map, please let me know on Discord (@worms / @ry6240) and I'll try to fix it if I'm able to. Also feel free to message me if you have any suggestions or feedback.

# 

# \*\*Known issues:\*\*

# \- Interactables might rarely spawn inside other interactables
