Marion, and Carney, and my gifts, and everything. I slept on it a while. And I think, I think I did it right, 'cause last night I saw something - like a memory, or a déjà vu, or something!\r\n\r\nIt was our camp, where it was, but it wasn't dead anymore - there were so many bushes and trees and leaves, and it covered my whole eyes, it made me so sick! Too much - it was too much!\r\n\r\nBut I couldn't take it. I was so sick, and I sat there a while, but then... then it started all wilting away, and when I saw it, I saw Her Concepts - in the rotting wood, the dying grass - everything! And it felt s-so right...\r\n\r\n...... After that... yeah, then I saw our camp. Yeah, I saw Larson, Pugh, and Dillon, and, and - Pugh...\r\n\r\nY-yeah, everybody was there. And I knew something. They were so tired and I was so tired and I knew - I knew they all understood. Why I did it. And I thought maybe now Carney would understand it, too. Her Concepts.\r\n\r\nSo I went back. To the Altar. And he does - I can see it.\r\n\r\nBut the others, in the other camps? They don't know. They haven't been saved, by Her, yet.\r\n\r\n... I will be leaving soon.\r\n\r\nWeshan.\r\n<style=cMono>\r\nLocal audio transcriptions complete.\r\n<\/style>\r\n",
